While still in development, it is an app that allows the users to store their food in their pantry, tracks how good that food is, then suggests recipes to the user based on the food they have alongside their dietary preferences. Once the user finds a recipe, they simply press a button and the recipe ingredients are subtracted from their pantry, and if they run out it automatically adds them to their shopping list.',
