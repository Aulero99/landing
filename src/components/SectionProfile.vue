                    You can call me a full stack developer, web experience designer, experience engineer, UI, UX or any other industry title you like. Iâ€™m also a dedicated student of life with a large array of skills stemming from my experience as a web designer, developer, writer, presenter, avid gamer, snowboard enthusiast and more.

                  <p>
                    I don't like to limit myself to what I already know, rather I enjoy pushing the boundaries with what I can do by incorporating something new into every application I make. I have an endless amount of curiosity that drives me to seek out new experiences, which I weave into everything I do. As such, I`m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and roles with relative ease. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also like to sharpen my skills through new opportunities with like-minded individuals. Whether it be as a leader, or a teammate I am always eager to what I can do to help make something amazing. 
                  </p>
